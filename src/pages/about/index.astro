			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hello I'm Paul, a designer-developer based in York, UK. I built my first client website in 2001 learning as I went. <a href="#">20 years later</a> Iâ€™m taking a number of courses to fill gaps in my knowledge and become a better developer. This website is home to a few learning <a href="#">projects</a> charting my progress and <a href="#">writings</a> about what I learn.</p>
