Light, electromagnetic radiation that can be detected by the human eye. **Electromagnetic radiation** occurs over an extremely wide range of wavelengths, from gamma rays with wavelengths less than about 1 × 10−11 metre to radio waves measured in metres. Within that broad spectrum the wavelengths visible to humans occupy a very narrow band, from about 700 nanometres (nm; billionths of a metre) for red light down to about 400 nm for violet light.

```js
const btn = document.getElementById(‘btn’);
let count = 0;

function render() {
  btn.innerText = `Count: ${count}`;
}
```
